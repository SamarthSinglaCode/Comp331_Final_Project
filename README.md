Nutrition Data Quality Analysis
This project focuses on evaluating the quality of real-world nutritional data used for understanding food products and supporting personalized health recommendations. Many modern health and nutrition applications depend on large public datasets to analyze the nutritional content of foods, identify health risks, and guide users toward healthier choices. However, these datasets often contain problems such as missing values, inconsistent units, incorrect labels, and unrealistic nutrient information. These issues can affect the accuracy of any system that uses the data, including data warehouses, analytical dashboards, and machine learning models.

To explore these challenges, this project examines two widely used public datasets: USDA FoodData Central and Open Food Facts. These datasets include essential details such as calories, sugar, fat, sodium, ingredients, serving sizes, barcodes, brands, and product categories. They are commonly used in applications like food tracking apps, nutrition analysis tools, and machine learning models that classify foods or predict health risks.

The goal of this project is to analyze the quality of the data by focusing on key data quality dimensions such as completeness, consistency, and validity. The analysis highlights common problems—for example, missing nutrient fields, mismatched measurement units (kcal vs. kJ), unrealistic values (like negative nutrients), and inconsistent brand or category names. These issues can lead to unreliable results, incorrect insights, and errors in downstream systems.

By applying concepts from Data Warehousing and Data Mining, the project explains how these issues impact ETL processes, fact table accuracy, and machine learning performance. Finally, the project provides recommendations for improving data quality so that nutritional datasets can be used more reliably in real-world health and analytics applications.
